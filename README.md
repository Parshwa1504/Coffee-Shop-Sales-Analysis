Coffee Shop Sales Analysis 📊
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing coffee shop sales data using SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and insights generation. The cleaned and structured data was then visualized using Power BI, creating an interactive dashboard for business decision-making.

Steps Followed in SQL 🛠️
Data Walkthrough – Understanding the dataset structure and identifying key columns.
Raw Data File Preparation – Ensuring the dataset is correctly formatted for import.
Creating Database – Setting up the MySQL database to store coffee shop sales data.
Importing File – Loading the dataset into MySQL for analysis.
Cleaning Imported Data – Handling missing values, duplicate entries, and incorrect formatting.
Changing Data Types – Modifying date, time, and numeric columns to the correct formats.
Executing SQL Queries for Business Insights – Extracting meaningful KPIs and trends.
Storing Results – Preparing the transformed data for visualization.
Preparing SQL Documentation – Recording all queries and steps taken for future reference.
